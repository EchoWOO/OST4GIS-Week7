        <h1>Childhood Lead Exposure Map in Minnesota</h1>
        <p class="main">Preventing early-life exposure to lead is important for life-long health. Elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in young children are linked with adverse health effects, including learning problems, behavioral problems, and even death if exposures are very high. Children less than 6 years of age living in homes built before 1978 are most at risk for lead exposure. Younger children are at greater risk because their bodies absorb lead more easily and their brains are still developing.</p>
        <p>By combining 5 years of blood lead surveillance data, this map displays data using a small geographic unit (census tract) while still protecting data privacy and ensuring estimate precision. The statewide prevalence of children with elevated blood lead levels declined throughout this time period, but we can still see that the EBLLs in young children is still really high in some region in Minnesota. This map will help to observe and detect the spatial distribution of the environment with high lead exposures. </p>
